# Rate My Lord

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repo. This idea came to me, at the beginning of last year, as I was looking for housing around my school. A lot of students had feedback on which landlords were really good and which to avoid, but there was never really a consensus and/or place to get such information quickly. The most that I found was a facebook post, with thousands of comments of who was good and who wasn't good, and I didn't want to read through that many comments anymore. 

This is where the intention for Rate My Lord came up, and I've been playing around with the idea ever since. 

## Functionalities 

 + Implementation with google maps 
 + Storage of review on firebase 

## What I learned 

 + This was my first-ever web project. It's hard (but fun!)
